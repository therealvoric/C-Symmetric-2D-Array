# C-Symmetric-2D-Array
This repository contains a C program that reads in a 2D array of integers from the user and checks if it is symmetric or not. If the array is symmetric, the program prints "Symmetrisch: Ja" (which means "Symmetric: Yes" in English), otherwise it prints "Symmetrisch: Nein" (which means "Symmetric: No" in English).
